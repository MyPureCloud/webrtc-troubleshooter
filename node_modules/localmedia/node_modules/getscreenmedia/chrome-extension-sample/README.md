The browser use—ï [chrome.runtime.sendMessage](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#method-sendMessage) to talk to the backend script which calls [chooseDesktopMedia](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/desktopCapture) and returns the sourceId of the chosen window. This sourceId has to be passed back to getUserMedia.
