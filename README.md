# webrtc-devices

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MyPureCloud/ember-webrtc-devices.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MyPureCloud/ember-webrtc-devices)

This addon is designed to provide you with two things:

1. A mixin (probably useful on a service) for enumerating devices, and setting
up all the basic stuff.

2. A component for selecting those devices

## Installation

* `git clone` this repository
* `npm install`
* `bower install`
